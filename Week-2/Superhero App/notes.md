## 🧱 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. 📄 Basic HTML Setup
- Created individual HTML files for each superhero (e.g., `thor.html`, `ironman.html`, `mils.html`, etc.).
- Used tags like:
  - `<h2>` for the hero name
  - `<img>` inside a `.gallery` for visuals
  - `<p><b>…</b></p>` for bio and power stats
- Included a `<link rel="stylesheet">` for external CSS.

**What I learned:**
- How to structure semantic HTML.
- Importance of consistent formatting and nesting of tags.
- How to display images and group content meaningfully.

---

### 2. 🎨 Adding CSS Styling
- Tried both external (`style.css`) and internal (`<style>` inside `<head>`) styles.
- Applied custom styling:
  - Background colors
  - Font types
  - Borders and shadows for images
  - Hover effects to make it interactive
  - Masculine color palette: Navy, steel gray, neon blue, orange highlights

**What I learned:**
- CSS selectors and properties.
- How to write inline vs. external styles.
- The effect of color schemes and typography on mood (guyish vs. girly but elegant).

---

### 3. 🌸 Custom Theming (Girly and Guyish)
- Customized styles for different characters based on gender/personality:
  - **Girly:** Light purples, soft grays, elegant fonts (no pink)
  - **Guyish:** Dark themes, sharp contrasts, neon highlights

**What I learned:**
- How to design themes based on personas.
- That color theory and visual identity matter in UI.

---

### 4. 🌐 Linking Pages (Navigation)
- Created `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html`.
- Used anchor tags `<a href="about.html">About</a>` to navigate between them.

**What I learned:**
- Linking between pages using `href`.
- Folder and file naming best practices.
- Making navigation user-friendly and intuitive.

---

### 5. 📞 Building the Contact Page
- Made a simple `contact.html` page with dummy contact info.
- Added more spacing using `<br/>` and margins in CSS.

**What I learned:**
- How to create readable layouts.
- Simple form-style sections using only HTML (no JavaScript yet).
- Consistency is key to a clean UI.

---

## ✅ Key Wins

- Understood the basics of web structure (HTML/CSS).
- Customized styles to reflect personality and creativity.
- Practiced linking multiple HTML pages together.
- Gained confidence in switching between design styles.

---

## ❗ Things to Improve Next Time

- Use more reusable CSS classes instead of repeating styles.
- Improve responsiveness for mobile (media queries).
- Add navigation bar to all pages.
- Start using semantic HTML elements like `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>`.
