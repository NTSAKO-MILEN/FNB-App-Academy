# üìé  Notes for Getting started with CSS

## üé® What is CSS and Why It's Important to Me

As I dive deeper into web development, I‚Äôve learned that **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes my websites look amazing. It lets me **style the structure** created with HTML, making everything visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **CSS controls the look and feel** of my site (like colors, fonts, and background images).
- It‚Äôs **separate from HTML**, which is the structure. HTML = bones, CSS = clothes and makeup!

## üöÄ Why CSS is a Game Changer for My Website

Here‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt live without CSS:

- **Faster loading times**: Since CSS can be cached, it speeds up my website.
- **Saves time**: I only need to define the style once in my `style.css`, and it‚Äôs applied to my whole site.
- **Makes maintenance easier**: Changes in the CSS file apply everywhere, so I don't have to edit each page separately.

## üóÇÔ∏è Lesson 2: Linking External CSS File

### ‚ö° How to Use External CSS to Style My Website

1. **Create a `style.css` file**. This is where all my styles live.
2. **Link `style.css`** to my `index.html` in the `<head>` section:
   ```html
   <head>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   </head>
   ```

3. **Start styling** in `style.css`. For example, change the color of the heading:
   ```css
   h1 {
     color: green;
   }

   p {
     color: coral;
   }
   ```

## üñãÔ∏è CSS Fonts: How to Change Fonts on My Website

1. **Set the font family** using the `font-family` property. For example:
   ```css
   h1 {
     font-family: sans-serif;
   }

   p {
     font-family: fantasy;
   }
   ```

2. **Other important tips:**
   - **Hyphenated Properties**: Use dashes like `font-size` or `font-weight`.
   - **Font Size Units**: Don‚Äôt forget to add units like `px` (e.g., `font-size: 14px;`).
