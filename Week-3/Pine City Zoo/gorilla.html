          <h3>GORILLA</h3>
          <h1>ü¶ç Welcome to the Gorilla Exhibit!</h1>

          <p>
            The <strong>Gorilla</strong> is one of the most powerful and intelligent primates, native to the forests of
            Central and West Africa. Gorillas are the largest of all primates, with adult males known as "silverbacks"
            because of the distinctive silver fur on their backs. They live in social groups, and their behavior is
            closely related to that of humans.
          </p>

          <h2>üí° Fun Facts:</h2>
          <ul class="facts">
            <li>Gorillas are predominantly herbivores, with a diet mainly consisting of leaves, stems, and fruit.</li>
            <li>Despite their size, gorillas are gentle and peaceful creatures, rarely aggressive unless threatened.</li>
