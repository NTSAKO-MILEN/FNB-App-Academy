          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <h1>ðŸ¦’ Welcome to the Giraffe Exhibit!</h1>

          <p>
            The <strong>Giraffe</strong> is the world's tallest land animal, native to the savannas and open woodlands
            of sub-Saharan Africa. Known for their long necks and legs, giraffes can grow up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) tall!
            Their unique spotted coat patterns are as individual as human fingerprints.
          </p>

          <h2>ðŸ’¡ Fun Facts:</h2>
          <ul class="facts">
            <li>Giraffes' necks can be up to 6 feet long, and they can reach leaves in the tallest trees.</li>
            <li>Despite their height, giraffes only sleep for 10-30 minutes a day!</li>
            <li>Their tongues can be up to 18 inches long, helping them grab leaves and twigs from trees.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Giraffes have a peaceful, gentle nature and are often seen grazing in herds across the African savanna.</p>
