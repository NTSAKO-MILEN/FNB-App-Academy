          <h1>üêó Meet the Warthogs!</h1>

          <p>
            <strong>Warthogs</strong> are wild members of the pig family found in the savannas and grasslands of Africa. 
            Recognized by their large tusks, sturdy build, and warty facial features, these animals are tough survivors 
            of the wild.
          </p>
