# 🌐 Start Coding with HTML – My First Step Into Web Development

Welcome to my very first HTML project! This mini milestone marks the beginning of my web development journey, completed as part of the FNB App Academy curriculum.

## 📘 What I Learned

This activity introduced me to the **foundations of HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** — the core language used to structure content on the web. Here’s what I took away:

### 🏗️ HTML Basics
- HTML is not a programming language in the traditional sense — it’s a **markup language** used to create and organize the structure of a web page.
- Everything on a web page — text, images, buttons, videos — is structured using HTML tags.
- The current version, **HTML5**, brought modern features that support **multimedia, graphics, and mobile responsiveness**.

### ✨ Key Features of HTML5 I Explored
- `<video>` and `<audio>` for embedding multimedia
- `<canvas>` for drawing graphics
- **SVG** and **MathML** for scalable graphics and math formulas
- **Geolocation, Drag and Drop, Local Storage, Web Workers** — tools that bring interactivity and power to web pages, especially for mobile and cross-platform use

## 🧠 My Reflections
Before this, I’d only heard that “HTML is what websites are made of.” Now I’ve actually seen how a blank screen becomes a structured webpage with just a few tags. Even writing a simple heading or paragraph in HTML gave me a sense of control and creativity.

This was a small step, but a powerful one.

## 🚀 What’s Next?
- Creating my first full web page using basic HTML tags
- Exploring how HTML combines with **CSS** and **JavaScript**
- Building hands-on mini projects like a personal profile page or a portfolio

> “Every developer starts with a blank page — and a few opening tags.” 👩‍💻
