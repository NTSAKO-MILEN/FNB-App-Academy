# 🌐 Lesson 1: Start Coding with HTML – My First Step Into Web Development

Welcome to my very first HTML project! This mini milestone marks the beginning of my web development journey, completed as part of the FNB App Academy curriculum.

---

## 📘 What I Learned

This activity introduced me to the foundations of **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** — the core language used to structure content on the web. Here’s what I took away:

### 🏗️ HTML Basics

- HTML is not a programming language; it’s a **markup language** used to create and organize the structure of a web page.
- Everything on a web page — text, images, buttons, videos — is structured using HTML tags.
- The current version, **HTML5**, brings modern features that support multimedia, graphics, and mobile responsiveness.

### ✨ Key Features of HTML5 I Explored

- `<video>` and `<audio>` for embedding multimedia
- `<canvas>` for drawing graphics
- SVG and MathML for scalable graphics and math formulas
- Geolocation, Drag and Drop, Local Storage, Web Workers — tools that bring interactivity and power to modern web pages

---

## 🧠 My Reflections

Before this, I’d only heard that “HTML is what websites are made of.” Now I’ve actually seen how a blank screen becomes a structured webpage with just a few tags. Even writing a simple heading or paragraph in HTML gave me a sense of control and creativity.

> This was a small step, but a powerful one.

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?

- Creating my first full web page using basic HTML tags  
- Exploring how HTML combines with CSS and JavaScript  
- Building hands-on mini projects like a personal profile page or a portfolio

> “Every developer starts with a blank page — and a few opening tags.” 👩‍💻

# 🛠 Lesson 2: My First Web App Workspace

Welcome to my web app project! This is where all the files, folders, and code for my app will live. This document outlines how I set up my workspace and useful tips to keep my work organized and running smoothly.

---

## 🔧 My Workspace Setup

My workspace includes:

- **Text Editor** – I’ll be using *VS Code* to write and edit my code.
- **Web Browser** – I’ll preview my website using *Google Chrome*.
- **Project Folder** – This folder stores all files specific to my app or website.  
  📁 Folder Name: `my-first-app`

## 📄 My Starter HTML Page

Here's the base structure (the "skeleton") of every webpage I create:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Head content goes here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Visible page content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
``` 
# 🧾 Lesson 3: Start Coding with HTML – Creating Paragraphs

In this lesson, I created my **first functional web page** that displays paragraph text. This marks the beginning of giving actual content to my pages using HTML tags.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 📝 Paragraphs in HTML

- Paragraphs are defined using the `<p>` tag.
- Each paragraph starts with `<p>` and ends with `</p>`.
- Paragraphs must always be placed **inside the `<body>` section** of the HTML document.

---

## 💻 The Code I Wrote

Here’s the HTML code used in this lesson:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Metadata and page title go here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello from week 1!</p>
    <p>This is my first HTML file created inside the Week 1 journal folder using Gitpod</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

When opened in the browser, this displays two lines of text:

```
Hello from Week 1!
This is my first HTML file created inside the Week 1 journal folder using Gitpod.
```

# 🧾 Lesson 4: Creating a Heading – Structuring Web Content with HTML

In this lesson, I explored the importance and functionality of **HTML heading tags**. Headings are critical not only for organizing content visually but also for creating a clear document structure — which helps with accessibility, search engine optimization, and user navigation.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 📢 HTML Headings

- HTML provides **six levels of headings** from `<h1>` (largest/most important) to `<h6>` (smallest/least important).
- Headings should reflect the **hierarchical structure** of a document, just like an outline in a report.
- The `<h1>` tag is typically used for page titles or main topics, followed by `<h2>` for subsections, and so on.

---

## 💻 Code I Practiced With

Here’s the HTML code I wrote to practice using all six heading levels:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Head content goes here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Home page</h1>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
  </body>
</html>
```
When I opened this in the browser, I could visually see how each heading became smaller and less dominant as the number increased. It was a simple yet effective way to visualize the flow and structure of content.

### 🛠️ Best Practices I Followed

✅ All heading tags were placed inside the <body> section.

✅ I used proper syntax and matched open and closing tags.

✅ I saved the file correctly as .html and refreshed the browser to see changes live.

#### Completion Checklist ✅

- ✅ Created a new HTML file or edited `index.html`
- ✅ Added six heading tags from `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- ✅ Saved the file with the correct `.html` extension
- ✅ Viewed the result in a browser

💬 **Final Thoughts**

Seeing how heading tags automatically style text based on their importance showed me that HTML is doing more than just displaying words — it’s organizing and communicating structure to browsers, readers, and search engines.

This lesson taught me that even the smallest tag has a big role to play in building quality web pages.
